// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

              Planning
              Analysis of Requirements
              Design
              Implementation
              Testing & Integration
              Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."; 
const analysisOfRequirements = "The goal of analysis is to determine where the problem is, in an attempt to fix the system.";
const design = "It functions and operations are described in detail, including screen layouts, business rules, process diagrams, and other documentation.";
const implementation = "This is the stage where actual coding begins. The main focus of the phase is the development of perfect codes by the developers.";
const testingAndIntegration = "In this stage, all variants of the functional testing such as integration testing, unit testing, system testing, acceptance testing, and non-functional testing are done.";
const maintain = "Once the customers start using well-developed software, the actual issues start surfacing with time. This doesnâ€™t mean that the software will get corrupted. However, it might require occasional issues surfacing time and again. This particular process is termed as maintenance for the finalized product or software.";
